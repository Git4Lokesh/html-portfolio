 <h1>Lokesh's Favourite Movies</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies to watch: </h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</h3>
 <p>In my opinion, the best Mission Impossible movie in the series. Has the humour, action sequences and more importantly a good villian. 10/10 watch.</p>
 <hr />
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>Everyone knows Christopher Nolan is an incredible director. He's outdone himself in Interstellar. The plot will keep you hooked and Matheww Mconoughay doesn't seem like he's acting, this role seems far too familiar to him. To top off the plot,acting and stunning visuals you have an incredible soundtrack from Hans Zimmer. <br /><br /> Greatest Movie of All Time</p>
 <hr />

 <h3>The Amazing Spiderman</h3>
 <p>Every generation has their own spiderman, older ones grew up with Tobey Maguire, newer kids grew up with Tom Holland.<br /><br />As a current 21 year old, we grew up with Andrew Garfield, arguably the best actor amongst the three with the least popular Spiderman series. For some reason his rendition of the role is my favourite, his charisma and the witty one liners. I don't understand why the critics don't like it, it has a fun story, good chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew and great action sequences.<br /><br />Fun Watch</p>
